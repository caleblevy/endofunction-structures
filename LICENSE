This file outlines the copyright information and licensing terms of use for a
collection of mathematical programs for exploring combinatorial problems and
endofunction structures written primarily in python.

The bulk of the programs in the top level directory of this project were
written by Caleb Levy (caleb.levy@berkeley.edu). Those are licensed under the
terms described below. Some of the functions in these files were taken directly
or almost entirely from various websites (mostly Stack Overflow or the Stack
Exchange network), and these are cited as such. These are licensed under the
Creative Commons license, with details available on the site itself.

Work contained in the submodule PADS was written by David Eppstein. These are
licensed under the terms in ABOUT-PADS.txt found in that subfolder.

For code written by myself, the terms of non-commercial usage of this code are
simply providing credit of some variety, either in the typical list of
contributors section of the code repository or, if used for an academic paper,
some contribution in the paper. For commercial use, please contact me at
caleb.levy@berkeley.edu.
