The bulk of the programs in the endofunction_structures/ and tests/ directories
of this project were written by Caleb Carson Levy from early 2014 to 2015,
though some algorithms were derived as early as 2012.

For code written by myself, the terms of non-commercial are simply providing
credit of some variety, either in the typical list of contributors section of
the code repository, in source code comments if usuing particular lines of code
or functions, or receiving some form of acknowledgement or citation if used in
an academic paper. 

The terms of commercial use can be discussed on a case-by-case basis by
contacting me at caleb.levy@berkeley.edu.

The submodule PADS was written entirely by Dr. David Eppstein. His work is
