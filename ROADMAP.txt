Early January 2015:

    # Modules with ACCEPTABLE NAMES from which NOTHING SHOULD BE REMOVED:
    #   - funcdists
    #   - funcstructs
    #   - rootedtrees
    #   - integerroots
    #   - necklaces
    #   - multiset
    #   - rotation (Maybe...)
    #   - polynomials (for now...)
    #
    # Modules with UNSUITABLE NAMES from which NOTHING SHOULD BE REMOVED:
    #   - primes -> should go to factor, factors, or factorization
    #   - monotones -> should be renamed to subseq, subsequence, or subsequences
    #   - nestops -> should be renamed to nesting, nests, something (Maybe...)
    #
    # Modules up for dissassembly:
    #   - iteration: acknowledged at the time of its creation as a miscillaneous
    #     generator dump, it has to go.

    # Ideas that should VERY LIKELY be persued:
    #   - Make RootedTrees collection class
    #     * __len__ will be rooted_treecount
    #     * __in__ will be rooted tree check'
    #     * __iter__ is the rooted_trees generator
    #     * __next__ is successor tree
    #   - Make a RootedTree object.
    #     * chop -> tree.chop()
    #     * tree_to_func -> tree.func_form()
    #     * canonical_treeorder -> tree.canonical_form()
    #     * len(tree) -> __len__
    #     * hypothetical is_tree function -> __eq__
    #     * Ordering -> __cmp__, __le__, __eq__
    #
    # Ideas that should POSSIBLY be explored:
    #   - Corresponding CanonicalRootedTree and CanonicalRootedTrees
    #   - LabelledRootedTree/UnlabelledRootedTree

February 2, 2015:
    # Ideas that should VERY LIKELY be persued:
    #   - Make my own Multiset classes based off of the bag module.
    #   - Funcstruct class
    #   - Endofunction class
    #
    # Ideas that should PROBABLY be persued
    #   - Forest class (derived from my custom Multiset classes)
    #   - Corresponding Canonical"..." classes with sorting methods.
    #   - Necklace classes.

February 4, 2015:
    #
    # Trees:
    #   - Want to make forest class
    #   - Using this, add a splice method to produce a tree
    #   - Add a sort method to RootedTree to enable...
    #   - Making a Canonical Rooted Tree
    #   - Make a forest enumerator class
    #
    # Print:
    #   - Give that class string print.
    #   - Update multiset __repr__ to reflect __str__
    #
    # Necklaces:
    #   - Make a Necklace (Cycle?)class
    #   - Make Necklace enumerator (len gets wrapped in as necklace_count)
    #   - Give it a class method: From multiset (or it takes a multiset...)
    #
    # Funcstructs and Endofunctions
    #   - Make Multiset.partitions return multiset of multisets
    #   - Make Funcstruct class and Endofunction class
    #   - Make Funcstruct enumerator class (classmethod from func)


February 5, 2015:
    # - Replace RootedTree.bracket_form with RootedTree.set_form, and make it
    #   nested frozensets as I had originally intended.
    # - Replace O(n^2) preimage with O(n) set based preimage.
