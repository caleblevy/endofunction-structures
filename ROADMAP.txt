Early January 2015:

# Modules with ACCEPTABLE NAMES from which NOTHING SHOULD BE REMOVED:
#   - funcdists
#   - funcstructs
#   - rootedtrees
#   - integerroots
#   - necklaces
#   - multiset
#   - rotation (Maybe...)
#   - polynomials (for now...)
#
# Modules with UNSUITABLE NAMES from which NOTHING SHOULD BE REMOVED:
#   - primes -> should go to factor, factors, or factorization
#   - monotones -> should be renamed to subseq, subsequence, or subsequences
#   - nestops -> should be renamed to nesting, nests, something (Maybe...)
#
# Modules up for dissassembly:
#   - iteration: acknowledged at the time of its creation as a miscillaneous
#     generator dump, it has to go.

Ideas that should VERY LIKELY be persued:

  - Make RootedTrees collection class
    * __len__ will be rooted_treecount
    * __in__ will be rooted tree check'
    * __iter__ is the rooted_trees generator
    * __next__ is successor tree

  - Make a RootedTree object.
    * chop -> tree.chop()
    * tree_to_func -> tree.func_form()
    * canonical_treeorder -> tree.canonical_form()
    * len(tree) -> __len__
    * hypothetical is_tree function -> __eq__
    * Ordering -> __cmp__, __le__, __eq__

Ideas that should POSSIBLY be explored:
  - Corresponding CanonicalRootedTree and CanonicalRootedTrees
  - LabelledRootedTree/UnlabelledRootedTree
